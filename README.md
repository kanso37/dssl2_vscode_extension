# HOW TO USE

Simply clone this project into a folder called "dssl2_vscode_extension"
and then put that folder in ~/.vscode/extensions

Quit VS Code and reopen it. .rkt files should now have syntax highlighting!

Or just open command palette and >Reload Window

It works pretty well with the "One Dark Pro" theme. I haven't tried it with other color themes.
